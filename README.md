# **Delilah Resto**

#### Third project from the Full Stack Web Development bootcamp in Ac√°mica.

The project goal was to create the back-end for a food delivery app, the architecture design, database, endpoints and documentation.

Front-end is included in the repository. It was intended to be analogous to a mobile app and is fully functional, but as it was not required for the approval of the project its just experimental. For best front-end example go to [gifOS](https://github.com/JM-SE/gifOS-Project) project.

## Instalation and Initialization

### _1. Clone Project_

Clone the repository from your terminal:

```
git clone https://github.com/JM-SE/Delilah-Resto-Project.git .`
```

Or download the repository and open the folder in your IDE.

### _2. Install the required dependencies_

In your terminal execute command:

```
npm install
```

### _3. Creating the database_

-   Open XAMPP and start Apache Web Server, ProFTDP and MySQL Database in port `3306`.
-   Open MySQL Workbench or any other tool for database architecture.
-   Connect Workbench to DB in host `localhost` with `username: root` and `password` should be empty.
-   Create database called `delilah`.
-   Execute command `npm run dev` in terminal to start the server. Sequelize automatically creates the required tables in the database.
-   Admin user is created automatically after the server is synchronized with the database. The default credentials for admin user are `username: admin` and `password: admin` this credentials can be changed in the front-end or by using Postman.
-   Populate products table by opening `Documentation/queries.sql` with Workbench, or copy and paste the queries inside the file. If you wish you can create your own products.

### _4. Starting the server_

If server not running already, in your terminal execute command:

```
npm start
```

If you want to edit files from the project execute command:

```
npm run dev
```

`And`

```
npm run watch:js
```

### _5. The app is ready to use_

The app is ready to be tested by importing the collection included (`Documentation/Delilah.postman_collection.json`) to _Postman_ or in your web browser by entering the [front-end](http://localhost:5000/).

_If *Postman* is used `Dev:Delilah` enviroment must be selected._
